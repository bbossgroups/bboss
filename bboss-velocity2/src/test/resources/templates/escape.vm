@test escape.vm

This template is used for Velocity regression testing.
If you alter this template make sure you change the
corresponding comparison file so that the regression 
test doesn't fail incorrectly.

*#

\A

\#set($woo = "bar")
#set($woo = "bar")

\$woo => $woo

The following should print 'as is' : 
$f\oo
\a
"\r"

Now, test the built in directives. Note that $foo isn't in the context :
\#set($foo = $foo + 1)
\#set(\$foo = $foo + 1)
\#if($foo)
\#if ( $foo )
\#else
\#end
\#elseif(

Now, a reference not in the context:
\$foo -> $foo
\#if($foo)
\#if(\$foo)

Put it in :
#set($foo = 1)
\$foo -> $foo
\#if($foo)
\#if(\$foo)

This isn't in the context, so we get the full monty :
	\$woobie.blagh()

The following two are references :
	\$provider.Title = $provider.Title
	\$provider.getTitle() = $provider.getTitle()

Now, pluggable directives:

\#notadirective
\#foreach

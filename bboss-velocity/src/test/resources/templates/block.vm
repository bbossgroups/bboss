This template is used for Velocity regression testing.
If you alter this template make sure you change the
corresponding comparison file so that the regression 
test doesn't fail incorrectly.

*#
First test : spacing between stuff.  Note that spacing preceeding the directives counts!
One blank line follows

#set($foo = false)
#if ($foo)
    this is true
#elseif ($bar)
    this is false
#elseif (true)
    this should be followed by two blank lines
#end


#if (true)
    this is the if statement. (followed by two blank lines)

    #if (true)
    
        this is great (followed by a blank line, 4 spaces on a line,and 2 more, yes there should be one after the 4 spaces)

    #elseif (false)
        this is also great.
    #end

#elseif (true)
    this is the first elseif.
#elseif (false)
    this is the second elseif.
#else
    this is the else statement
#end

-- Second Test : no spacing between anything (1 blank line follows)

#set($foo = false)
#if ($foo)
    this is true
#elseif ($bar)
    this is false
#elseif (true)
    this
#end
#if (true)
    this is the if statement.
    #if (true)
        this is great (line w/ 4 spaces follows (from in front of the \#end) + another blank line)
    #elseif (false)
        this is also great.
    #end
#elseif (true)
    this is the first elseif.
#elseif (false)
    this is the second elseif.
#else
    this is the else statement
#end

------------

	<ant:title>Svn Selectors</ant:title>
	
	<ant:introduction>
		<p>
			This document describes the file selectors offered in svnAnt. To use those selectors,
			you must first obtain a copy of svnant.jar, add it to the classpath of your ant project
			and define the types. Fortunately, there is a resource file, within the distributed JAR file,
			and all those steps can be accomplished with the following code:
			<ant:example>
				<![CDATA[
<path id="svnant.classpath">
  <pathelement location="${svnant.dir}/lib/svnant.jar" />
  <pathelement location="${svnant.dir}/lib/svnClientAdapter.jar" />
</path>  

<typedef resource="svntypes.xml" classpathref="project.classpath"/>
				]]>
			</ant:example>
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are upgrading from an earlier version of svnAnt, and the following line was used
			in your <i>build.xml</i> file, then replace it with the ones above.
			<ant:example>
				<![CDATA[
<taskdef resource="svntask.properties" classpathref="svnant.classpath"/>
				]]>
			</ant:example>
		</p>
		<h3><a name="bindings">Bindings</a></h3>
		<p>
			All file selectors offer two parameters: <b>javahl</b> and <b>svnkit</b>. Those parameters
			are booleans, which means their values can be set to either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>. 
			If not specified, those parameters are assumed to be set (true). These two parameters are used
			to select which client is used to access Subversion.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are three clients used by svnAnt to access Subversion:
			<ul>
				<li>JavaHL;</li>
				<li>SVNKit; and,</li>
				<li>Command Line Interface.</li>
			</ul>
			To better understand the difference between those three clients, please refer to
			documentation on <b>svnClientAdapter.jar</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The property <b>javahl</b> is considered only if the javahl libraries are available. Similarly,
			the property <b>svnkit</b> is considered only if SVNKit is present. Finally, <b>javahl</b>
			takes precedence over <b>svnkit</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			To better illustrate the previous paragraph, use the following steps:
			<ol>
				<li>If <b>javahl</b> is <i>true</i> and JavaHL bindings are available, then JavaHL is used.</li>
				<li>If <b>svnkit</b> is <i>true</i> and SVNKit is present, then SVNKit is used.</li>
				<li>If the two previous tests failed, for any reason, then the Command Line Interface is used.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<ant:shortDescription>File selector that performs discrimination based on the 'added' subversion status. </ant:shortDescription>
		<ant:fullDescription>
			<p>
				This file selector is used to discriminate files within a <b>fileset</b> based on a Subversion
				status. In particular, this selector keeps files that are recognized as 'added'.
			</p>
			<p>
				An 'added' file or directory is one that has been added to the repository, but not yet
				commited. In general, <b>svn status</b> displays those items with the letter <i>A</i>
				preceeding the name.
			</p>
			<p>
				Example: to copy a number of files with the status 'added' from their location in
				<b>workingcopy</b> to a new directory called <b>test</b>, the following ant task can
				be used:
				<ant:example>
<![CDATA[
<copy todir="test">
	<fileset dir="workingcopy">

		<ant:shortDescription>File selector that performs discrimination based on the 'modified' subversion status. </ant:shortDescription>
		<ant:fullDescription>
			<p>
				This file selector is used to discriminate files within a <b>fileset</b> based on a Subversion
				status. In particular, this selector keeps files that are recognized as 'modified'.
			</p>
			<p>
				A 'modified' file or directory is one that has been changed since the last update and where 
				the changes have not yet been commited to the repository. In general, <b>svn status</b>
				display those items with the letter <i>M</i> preceeding the name. It is important to note
				that other items can also be considered modified, such as conflicted ones.
			</p>
			<p>
				Example: to copy a number of files with the status 'modified' from their location in
				<b>workingcopy</b> to a new directory called <b>test</b>, the following ant task can

		<ant:shortDescription>File selector that performs discrimination based on the 'unversioned' subversion status. </ant:shortDescription>
		<ant:fullDescription>
			<p>
				This file selector is used to discriminate files within a <b>fileset</b> based on a Subversion
				status. In particular, this selector keeps files that are recognized as 'unversioned'.
			</p>
			<p>
				An 'unversioned' file or directory is one that is present in a working copy but is not yet
				known to the repository. In general, <b>svn status</b>
				display those items with a question mark (<i>?</i>) preceeding the name. Note that 'ignored'
				items are not considered 'unversioned'.
			</p>
			<p>
				Eexample: to copy a number of files with the status 'unversioned' from their location in
				<b>workingcopy</b> to a new directory called <b>test</b>, the following ant task can

		<ant:shortDescription>File selector that performs discrimination based on the 'conflicted' subversion status. </ant:shortDescription>
		<ant:fullDescription>
			<p>
				This file selector is used to discriminate files within a <b>fileset</b> based on a Subversion
				status. In particular, this selector keeps files that are recognized as 'conflicted'.
			</p>
			<p>
				When updating a subversion item (file or directory), it is possible to have two sets of 
				changes merged into the	working item. This happens when the item was modified locally as 
				well as remotely during the period since the last update. If the two sets of changes conflict
				(same lines of a file changes, same directory entries modified), then the item is marked
				as 'conflicted'. In general, <b>svn status</b> displays 'conflicted' items with the letter
				<i>C</i> preceeding the name. Note that 'conflicted' items are also considered 'modified'.
			</p>
			<p>
				Example: to copy a number of files with the status 'conflicted' from their location in
				<b>workingcopy</b> to a new directory called <b>test</b>, the following ant task can

		<ant:shortDescription>File selector that performs discrimination based on the 'ignored' subversion status. </ant:shortDescription>
		<ant:fullDescription>
			<p>
				This file selector is used to discriminate files within a <b>fileset</b> based on a Subversion
				status. In particular, this selector keeps files that are recognized as 'ignored'.
			</p>
			<p>
				An 'ignored' file or directory is one which name match the patterns found in the parent
				directory's <b>svn:ignore</b> property. In general, <b>svn status --no-ignore</b>
				display those items with the letter <i>I</i> preceeding the name.
			</p>
			<p>
				Example: to copy a number of files with the status 'ignored' from their location in
				<b>workingcopy</b> to a new directory called <b>test</b>, the following ant task can

		<ant:shortDescription>File selector that performs discrimination based on the 'locked' subversion status. </ant:shortDescription>
		<ant:fullDescription>
			<p>
				This file selector is used to discriminate files within a <b>fileset</b> based on a Subversion
				status. In particular, this selector keeps files that are recognized as 'locked'.
			</p>
			<p>
				A 'locked' file or directory is one where the repository has been informed of the
				intent of a user to prevent others from modifying the file. For a working copy to
				be aware of this fact, it must have been 'updated' since the lock status was changed.
				In general, <b>svn status</b> displays those items with one of the letters <i>K</i>,
				<i>O</i> or <i>B</i> in the sixth column. The 'lock' status is independent of most other
				conditions such as 'modified', 'conflicted', etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				Example: to copy a number of files with the status 'locked' from their location in
				<b>workingcopy</b> to a new directory called <b>test</b>, the following ant task can
				be used:
				<ant:example>
<![CDATA[
<copy todir="test">

		<ant:shortDescription>File selector that performs discrimination based on the 'normal' subversion status. </ant:shortDescription>
		<ant:fullDescription>
			<p>
				This file selector is used to discriminate files within a <b>fileset</b> based on a Subversion
				status. In particular, this selector keeps files that are recognized as 'normal'.
			</p>
			<p>
				A 'normal' file or directory is one that has not undergone any changes since the last
				update. In general, this is the great majority of the files in a working copy. <b>svn status</b>
				returns no special character for those items (a space in the first column).
			</p>
			<p>
				Example: to copy a number of files with the status 'normal' from their location in
				<b>workingcopy</b> to a new directory called <b>test</b>, the following ant task can

		<ant:shortDescription>File selector that performs discrimination based on the 'replaced' subversion status. </ant:shortDescription>
		<ant:fullDescription>
			<p>
				This file selector is used to discriminate files within a <b>fileset</b> based on a Subversion
				status. In particular, this selector keeps files that are recognized as 'replaced'.
			</p>
			<p>
				A 'replaced' file or directory is one that has been deleted, then created anew and finally 
				added back to the repository. Also, those changes must not have been comitted.
				In general, <b>svn status</b> displays those items with the letter <i>R</i> preceeding 
				the name.
			</p>
			<p>
				Example: to copy a number of files with the status 'replaced' from their location in
				<b>workingcopy</b> to a new directory called <b>test</b>, the following ant task can

		<ant:shortDescription>File selector that performs discrimination based on the 'missing' subversion status. </ant:shortDescription>
		<ant:fullDescription>
			<p>
				This file selector is used to discriminate files within a <b>fileset</b> based on a Subversion
				status. In particular, this selector keeps files that are recognized as 'missing'.
			</p>
			<p>
				A 'missing' file or directory is one that is managed by Subversion and
				has been deleted without using the remove command. In general, <b>svn status</b> 
				displays those items with the exclamation point (<i>!</i>) preceeding the name.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is important to note that a regular FileSet (the one supplied by ANT) can not
				detect a missing item, since it does not exist on the file system. To detect
				Subversion missing items, use the FileSet provided by svn-ant (svnFileSet).
			</p>
			<p>
				Example: to delete missing files from the repository associated with a <b>workingcopy</b>:
				<ant:example>
<![CDATA[
<svn>
	<delete>
		<svnFileSet dir="workingcopy">
			<svnMissing/>
		</svnFileSet>
	</delete>

		<ant:fullDescription>
			<p>
				This file selector is used to discriminate files within a <b>fileset</b> based on a Subversion
				status. In particular, this selector keeps files that are recognized as 'deleted'.
			</p>
			<p>
				A 'deleted' file or directory is one that has been erased using Subversion's 'remove'
				command. In general, <b>svn status</b> displays those items with the letter <i>D</i>
				preceeding the name.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is important to note that a regular FileSet (the one supplied by ANT) can not
				detect a deleted item, since it does not exist on the file system. To detect
				Subversion deleted items, use the FileSet provided by svn-ant (svnFileSet).

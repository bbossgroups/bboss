 * An interface defining life-cycle methods for

 * <p>
 * By contract, when an {@link ObjectPool}
 * delegates to a {@link PoolableObjectFactory},
 * <ol>
 *  <li>
 *   {@link #makeObject makeObject}
 *   is called whenever a new instance is needed.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   {@link #activateObject activateObject}
 *   is invoked on every instance that has been
 *   {@link #passivateObject passivated} before it is
 *   {@link ObjectPool#borrowObject borrowed} from the pool.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   {@link #validateObject validateObject}
 *   is invoked on {@link #activateObject activated} instances to make sure
 *   they can be {@link ObjectPool#borrowObject borrowed} from the pool.
 *   <code>validateObject</code> <strong>may</strong> also be used to test an
 *   instance being {@link ObjectPool#returnObject returned} to the pool
 *   before it is {@link #passivateObject passivated}. It will only be invoked
 *   on an activated instance.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   {@link #passivateObject passivateObject}
 *   is invoked on every instance when it is returned to the pool.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   {@link #destroyObject destroyObject}
 *   is invoked on every instance when it is being "dropped" from the
 *   pool (whether due to the response from <code>validateObject</code>,
 *   or for reasons specific to the pool implementation.) There is no
 *   guarantee that the instance being destroyed will
 *   be considered active, passive or in a generally consistent state.

 * {@link PoolableObjectFactory} must be thread-safe. The only promise
